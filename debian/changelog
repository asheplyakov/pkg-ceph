    script snippets for ceph-mon and ceph-create-keys - service restart

    (Closes: #769596).

  [ James Page ]
  * Added new "modules.patch" to mark new erasure coding libraries as
    modules, wildcard install.

  [ Dmitry Smirnov ]
  * Recommends: added "ntp" to list of time-daemon alternatives
    (Closes: #767511).
  * Introduced native systemd services (except "rbdmap"), (Closes: #769593).
  * ceph-test: install forgotten files.
  * Run post-build tests:
    + updated "virtualenv-never-download.patch" to pass
      "--system-site-packages" to virtualenv to prevent downloads.
    + added new patches to disable network-dependent and failing tests.
  * Patchworks:
    - bug-9341.patch
    + bug-10036.patch (to show OSD affinity in "ceph osd tree").
      Thanks, Mykola Golub.
    + bug-10059.patch
    + 0latest-giant.patch (Last-Update: 2014-11-15).
    + sleep-recover.patch
    + tests-disable.patch (to disable tests that need cluster).
    + tests-disable-ceph-disk.patch
    + use_system_gtest.patch (commented)
      as first attempt to build with system "libgtest-dev".
    + use_system_jerasure.patch
  * Build-Depends:
    + libjerasure-dev (>= 2.0.0-2~)
    + virtualenv
    + valgrind [amd64 armhf i386 powerpc]
  * rules: pass "--without-lttng" to explicitly disable "lttng" to avoid
    auto-enable if found.
  * rules: disabled bundled RocksDB:
    RocksDB suppose to improve performance of keyvaluestore OSDs but the
    latter slow down to nearly unusable state when filled over 1 TiB even with
    RocksDB. Moreover KV backend is experimental and super dangerous -- I lost
    cluster due to OSD poisoning caused by KV OSD which was plugged only
    during limited time. LevelDB is good enough, for now I see no reason to
    use RocksDB especially considering that it is not packaged separately.
  * Removed myself from Uploaders.
