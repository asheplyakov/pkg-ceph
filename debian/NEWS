ceph (0.55.1-0ubuntu1) raring; urgency=low

  The biggest change to watch out for with this release is that
  cephx authentication is now on by default.  That means that if
  you do not already explicitly enable or disable authentication
  in /etc/ceph/ceph.conf, upgrading will prevent your cluster from
  starting.
  .
  You need to either disable authentication explicitly, or enable
  it before upgrading. 
  .
  See http://ceph.com/docs/master/rados/operations/authentication/ for
  details.
