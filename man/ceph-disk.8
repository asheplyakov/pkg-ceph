.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBceph\-disk\fP is a utility that can prepare and activate a disk, partition or
directory as a Ceph OSD. It is run directly or triggered by \fBceph\-deploy\fP
or \fBudev\fP\&. It can also be triggered by other deployment utilities like \fBChef\fP,
\fBJuju\fP, \fBPuppet\fP etc.
.sp
It actually automates the multiple steps involved in manual creation and start
of an OSD into two steps of preparing and activating the OSD by using the
subcommands \fBprepare\fP and \fBactivate\fP\&.
.sp
\fBceph\-disk\fP also automates the multiple steps involved to manually stop
and destroy an OSD into two steps of deactivating and destroying the OSD by using
the subcommands \fBdeactivate\fP and \fBdestroy\fP\&.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.SS prepare
.sp
Prepare a directory, disk for a Ceph OSD. It creates a GPT partition,
marks the partition with Ceph type \fBuuid\fP, creates a file system, marks the
file system as ready for Ceph consumption, uses entire partition and adds a new
partition to the journal disk. It is run directly or triggered by
\fBceph\-deploy\fP\&.
.sp
Usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph\-disk prepare \-\-cluster [cluster\-name] \-\-cluster\-uuid [uuid] \-\-fs\-type
[ext4|xfs|btrfs] [data\-path] [journal\-path]

.sp
Other options like \fI\%\-\-osd\-uuid\fP, \fI\%\-\-journal\-uuid\fP,
\fI\%\-\-zap\-disk\fP, \fI\%\-\-data\-dir\fP, \fI\%\-\-data\-dev\fP,
\fI\%\-\-journal\-file\fP, \fI\%\-\-journal\-dev\fP, \fI\%\-\-dmcrypt\fP
and \fI\%\-\-dmcrypt\-key\-dir\fP can also be used with the subcommand.
.SS activate
.sp
Activate the Ceph OSD. It mounts the volume in a temporary location, allocates
an OSD id (if needed), remounts in the correct location
\fB/var/lib/ceph/osd/$cluster\-$id\fP and starts ceph\-osd. It is triggered by
\fBudev\fP when it sees the OSD GPT partition type or on ceph service start with
\fBceph disk activate\-all\fP\&. It is also run directly or triggered by
\fBceph\-deploy\fP\&.
.sp
Usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph\-disk activate [PATH]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here, [PATH] is path to a block device or a directory.
.sp
An additional option \fB\-\-activate\-key\fP has to be used with this
subcommand when a copy of \fB/var/lib/ceph/bootstrap\-osd/{cluster}.keyring\fP
isn\(aqt present in the OSD node.
.sp
Usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph\-disk activate [PATH] [\-\-activate\-key PATH]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Another option \fB\-\-mark\-init\fP can also be used with this
subcommand.  \fB\-\-mark\-init\fP provides init system to manage the OSD
directory. It defaults to \fBauto\fP which detects the init system
suitable for ceph (either \fBsysvinit\fP, \fBsystemd\fP or
\fBupstart\fP). The argument can be used to override the init system. It
may be convenient when an operating system supports multiple init
systems, such as Debian GNU/Linux jessie with \fBsystemd\fP and
\fBsysvinit\fP\&. If the argument is \fBnone\fP, the OSD is not marked with
any init system and \fBceph\-disk activate\fP needs to be called
explicitely after each reboot.
.sp
Usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph\-disk activate [PATH] [\-\-mark\-init *sysvinit|upstart|systemd|auto|none*]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the option \fB\-\-no\-start\-daemon\fP is given, the activation
steps are performed but the OSD daemon is not started.
.sp
The latest option \fB\-\-reactivate\fP can re\-activate the OSD which has been
deactivated with the \fBdeactivate\fP subcommand.
.sp
Usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph\-disk activate [PATH] [\-\-reactivate]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS activate\-journal
.sp
Activate an OSD via it\(aqs journal device. \fBudev\fP triggers
\fBceph\-disk activate\-journal <dev>\fP based on the partition type.
.sp
Usage:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.ft C
ceph\-disk activate\-journal [DEV]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS activate\-all
.sp
Activate all tagged OSD partitions. \fBactivate\-all\fP relies on
\fB/dev/disk/by\-parttype\-uuid/$typeuuid.$uuid\fP to find all partitions. Special
\fBudev\fP rules are installed to create these links. It is triggered on ceph
service start or run directly.

.SS suppress\-activate
.sp
Suppress activate on a device (prefix). Mark devices that you don\(aqt want to
activate with a file like \fB/var/lib/ceph/tmp/suppress\-activate.sdb\fP where the
last bit is the sanitized device name (/dev/X without the /dev/ prefix). A
function \fBis_suppressed()\fP checks for and  matches a prefix (/dev/). It means
suppressing sdb will stop activate on sdb1, sdb2, etc.
.sp
Usage:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph\-disk suppress\-activate [PATH]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here, [PATH] is path to a block device or a directory.
.SS unsuppress\-activate
.sp
Stop suppressing activate on a device (prefix). It is used to activate a device
that was earlier kept deactivated using \fBsuppress\-activate\fP\&.
.sp
Usage:

.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here, [PATH] is path to a block device or a directory.
.SS deactivate
.sp
Deactivate the Ceph OSD. It stops OSD daemon and optionally marks it out. The
content of the OSD is left untouched but the \fIready\fP, \fIactive\fP, \fIINIT\-specific\fP
files are removed (so that it is not automatically re\-activated by the \fBudev\fP
rules) and the file deactive is created to remember the OSD is deactivated.
If the OSD is dmcrypt, remove the data dmcrypt map. When deactivate finishes,
the OSD is \fBdown\fP\&. A deactivated OSD can later be re\-activated using the
\fB\-\-reactivate\fP option of the \fBactivate\fP subcommand.
.sp
Usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph\-disk deactivate [PATH]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here, [PATH] is a path to a block device or a directory.
.sp
Another option \fB\-\-mark\-out\fP can also be used with this subcommand.
\fB\-\-mark\-out\fP marks the OSD out. The objects it contains will be remapped.
If you are not sure you will destroy OSD, do not use this option.
.sp
You can also use \fBosd\-id\fP to deactivate an OSD with the option \fB\-\-deactivate\-by\-id\fP\&.
.sp

Another option \fB\-\-zap\fP can also be used with this subcommand.
\fB\-\-zap\fP will destroy the partition table and content of the disk.
.sp

.SS zap
.sp
Zap/erase/destroy a device\(aqs partition table and contents. It actually uses
\fBsgdisk\fP and it\(aqs option \fB\-\-zap\-all\fP to destroy both GPT and MBR data
structures so that the disk becomes suitable for repartitioning. \fBsgdisk\fP
then uses \fB\-\-mbrtogpt\fP to convert the MBR or BSD disklabel disk to a GPT
disk. The \fBprepare\fP subcommand can now be executed which will create a new
GPT partition. It is also run directly or triggered by \fBceph\-deploy\fP\&.
